**Pat has been a relationship coach for years now, while this practice can seem strange or shallow to most, the niche of relationship-coaching is becoming more and more prevalent today. He managed to build a good community of customers around his work, by writing articles, creating his newsletter and building rapport with his clients. But as his business grew, he eventually had an issue, while he was working with someone to update his website, he realized his visual branding was non-existent.**

From the beginning, the project was divided in several steps to have a more comprehensive process. There would be a first phase of understanding the business and his brand outside the visual spectrum. In knowing Pat's business and activity, it would be much easier to relate to his customers. Surprisingly, men and women came to him for his services. what set him apart his competitors, was his more nuanced and spiritual approach, while using philosophical and esoteric concepts. 

The second phase was directly related to the design. I needed to make the elements of the visual branding easily appliable to his website who was being updated while staying faithful to what he wanted to evoke with his brand. Pat gave me a few examples of websites, designs, color palettes he liked, and I used those to "synthetize" his visual universe through moodboards and stylescapes.

After several propositions, we settled on one direction.

> Visually representing values, going from words to visuals.

With a defined direction, I more clearly defined the fonts, the color palette, and started to work on the logo. I sketched several propositions that focused on the same elements, a serif font and an icon. The logo has been a nod to ancient books of alchemy and esoterism since the early sketches. After one direction was picked, I worked on the final version.

The color palette, fonts, and the logo were enough for the website to be completed by the webdesigner, and for Pat to have a visual identity. I then did banners for his social media according the the previously defined guidelines.
