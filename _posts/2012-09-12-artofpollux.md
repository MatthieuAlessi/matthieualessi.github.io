**I have wanted for a while to have a platform where I could post and journal about my personal hobbies of art and illustration, eventually I decided to build this side-project both as an opportunity to archive my endeavours and as a way to build up my webdesign skills with the Wordpress CMS and hone my HTML/CSS abilites.**

I started by designing a logo and defining a visual identity around it, being attracted to the imagery of Mercury. I took the liberty of using the name of Pollux, a star of the Gemini constellation, and Mercury who is the ruler of Gemini in astrology and mythology to build the logo and the choose the name.

Having a name and a logo, I had to pick a domain name, and think of how the website would look like. I didn't want to build on a too distinguished theme, instead deciding to stay on a masonry layout with the simpler and minimalist theme Koji. I wanted the content to be the center of the project, not a flashy and heavy theme that would hinder both the website performance but also the intent behind it.

<I had to tweak the CSS to adapt the responsive settings of the theme to one more suited to my needs, those changes keep the architecture of the original theme which was good, but still allow me to customize it enough for it to be a little different. The Fonts were also changed, which plays a lot in a webdesign visual identity.

This side-project was a good opportunity to build something that I hope will last for me, it allows me to not only journal and archive my digital illustrations and my tradiotional works, but it is also a great outset into writing and structuring ideas in english.
